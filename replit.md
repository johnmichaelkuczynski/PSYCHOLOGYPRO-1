# Overview

Psychology Pro is a cognitive/psychological/psychopathological profiler web application built with a React frontend and Node.js/Express backend. The application serves as a passthrough system that facilitates analysis of text content through multiple AI language models, focusing on cognitive, psychological, and psychopathological assessments. Features full cognitive profiling with real-time streaming, multi-chunk text analysis, and enhanced scoring calibration.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
- **React SPA**: Built with TypeScript using Vite as the build tool and development server
- **UI Framework**: Utilizes shadcn/ui components with Radix UI primitives for consistent design
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS custom properties for theming and responsive design
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management and API caching
- **Routing**: wouter library for lightweight client-side routing
- **File Handling**: Custom file parsing utilities supporting TXT, DOC, and DOCX formats (PDF removed after implementation failures)
- **Text Chunking**: Automatic chunking system for both uploaded files and copy-pasted text over 1000 words
- **Multi-Chunk Selection**: Advanced chunk selection interface allowing analysis of multiple text segments simultaneously

## Backend Architecture
- **Express.js Server**: RESTful API with middleware for request logging and error handling
- **TypeScript**: Full TypeScript implementation across both frontend and backend
- **File Upload**: Multer middleware for handling multipart file uploads with size limitations
- **Streaming**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time analysis progress updates
- **Memory Storage**: In-memory storage implementation with interface abstraction for future database migration

## Data Storage Solutions
- **Drizzle ORM**: Database abstraction layer configured for PostgreSQL with migration support
- **Schema Design**: Analysis and discussion entities with JSON storage for flexible result structures
- **Memory Fallback**: Temporary in-memory storage implementation during development phase

## Authentication and Authorization
- Session-based authentication system using connect-pg-simple for PostgreSQL session storage
- No current authentication implementation - prepared for future user management

## Analysis Processing Architecture
- **Multi-LLM Integration**: Support for four AI providers (aliased as ZHI 1-4)
- **Batch Processing**: Questions sent in batches of 5 to manage token limits and response quality
- **Streaming Service**: Real-time analysis progress with pause/resume functionality
- **Discussion System**: Post-analysis dialogue capability for result refinement and contestation

# Recent Changes (September 28, 2025)

## Critical Bug Fix - ZHI 4 Streaming Issue Resolution
✅ **ZHI 4 Garbled Text Issue Resolved**: Fixed critical streaming decoder bug that was causing ZHI 4 to produce fragmented, nonsensical text output during analysis

✅ **Stream Decoder Enhancement**: Implemented proper UTF-8 streaming support with `{ stream: true }` parameter to handle partial character sequences across network chunks

✅ **Buffering System Added**: Created intelligent buffering mechanism to accumulate text chunks and prevent JSON data from being truncated mid-line during Server-Sent Events processing

✅ **Line Processing Fix**: Enhanced line splitting logic to retain incomplete lines in buffer for next iteration, ensuring complete JSON parsing and coherent text assembly

✅ **Production Security**: Added development-only debug logging to prevent user content exposure in production environments while maintaining debugging capability for development

✅ **End-to-End Validation**: Comprehensive testing confirms ZHI 4 now produces coherent, well-formatted analysis responses that stream properly in real-time, achieving parity with other providers

# Previous Changes (September 27, 2025)

## Latest Critical Fixes - LLM Provider and User Experience Improvements 
✅ **ZHI 4 Fixed**: Updated invalid model name from 'llama-3.1-sonar-large-128k-online' to valid 'sonar-pro' - ZHI 4 API now working properly

✅ **ZHI 2 Debugging**: Added debugging infrastructure to diagnose "No content received" errors - configuration verified as correct per current API specifications

✅ **Save Button Enhancement**: Implemented visual saving indicator with spinner animation and "Saving..." text providing immediate user feedback during save operations

✅ **Saved Analysis Count Fix**: Optimized query strategy to immediately update saved analysis count in header after saving, eliminating previous delay

✅ **Session Management Stability**: Resolved session table constraint conflicts that were causing authentication failures - cleaned up database artifacts for stable session handling

✅ **Complete Authentication System**: Successfully tested end-to-end authentication flow including registration, login, logout, user history, and personal analysis management

## Previous Major Update - Fast Micro Analysis Implementation
✅ **Ultra-Fast Micro Analysis Types**: Successfully implemented three new high-speed analysis options with dramatically reduced processing times

✅ **Micro Cognitive Analysis**: Added microcognitive analysis with 1-2 sentence responses per question, reducing analysis time from 10-25 minutes to just a few minutes

✅ **Micro Psychological Analysis**: Implemented micropsychological analysis using same assessment standards but ultra-concise response format for rapid processing

✅ **Micro Psychopathological Analysis**: Added micropsychopathological analysis with specialized prompts requesting brief 1-2 sentence evaluations

✅ **Uniform Scoring System**: Implemented consistent scoring where HIGH SCORES ALWAYS mean good/positive evaluation across all questions. Eliminated confusion where some questions used low scores for good performance (e.g., "Is it phony?" now gives 95/100 for authentic text, not 5/100)
