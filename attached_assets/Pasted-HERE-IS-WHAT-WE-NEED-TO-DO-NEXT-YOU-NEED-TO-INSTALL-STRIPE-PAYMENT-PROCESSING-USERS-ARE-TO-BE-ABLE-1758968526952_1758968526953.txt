ZHI 1 

Merits

Fast, cheap, widely compatible.

Good balance of creativity + accuracy.

Reliable at short/medium rewrites and commercial text.

Demerits

Struggles with very dense scholarly material (drops nuance).

More “AI-detected” feel in raw outputs (less human signal).

Occasionally hallucinates stylistic quirks.

Anthropic (Claude)

ZHI 2 

Excellent on scholarly, philosophical, and “thinking-through” tasks.

Strong at staying consistent in long rewrites.

More “polished” tone, good for academic-sounding prose.

Demerits

By far the most expensive.

Sometimes cautious / verbose, especially when asked for edgy or non-academic rewrites.

Can “over-summarize” instead of fully transforming.

ZHI 3

Merits

Cheapest by far.

Handles bulk text rewriting and simple transformations well.

Decent logical coherence, especially for structured rewriting.

Demerits

Noticeably slower than the others.

Less nuanced on subtle philosophy/literature than Anthropic.

Output can feel mechanical if pushed beyond bulk processing.

ZHI 4

Merits

Very cheap for API calls (currently subsidized).

Good for quick turnarounds, exploratory rewrites.

Sometimes surprisingly concise and pointed.

Demerits

Quality varies — can be shallow compared to Anthropic/OpenAI.

Weak on sustained long-form consistency.
