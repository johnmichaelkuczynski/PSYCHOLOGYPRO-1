ORIGINAL TEXT:
Sometimes I wonder if what I call “my thoughts” are actually mine, or if they are borrowed fragments, half-digested and reissued in a voice that only pretends to be my own. There are moments when I feel like an impostor inhabiting my own body, a tenant in a house with too many locked rooms, each door marked with symbols I don’t understand. At times the locked rooms seem protective, like they shield me from knowing something that might unravel me; at other times they feel like prisons I built myself just to justify why I can’t move forward. I oscillate between the conviction that I am hiding from others and the suspicion that it is others who are hiding from me, and in either case the uncertainty produces the same dull ache. Even my memories seem untrustworthy—vivid in flashes, but distorted in ways that make me doubt whether I invented them after the fact, as though my life were a story I keep revising without realizing that the edits are replacing the original pages.
